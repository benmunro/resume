## Work Experience

[Nov 2012 - Mar 2017]{.job-header}
:   ### Software Developer for Verizon Telematics {.job-header}

    <p class="technologies">C#, Javascript, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes</p>

    At Telogis I worked as a full stack developer.  My primary responsibility
    was moving the company's software from a monolithic application to a services
    based architecture. This involved creating services to expose the data we
    collected and rewriting other applications to use these services rather than
    accessing the raw data directly. As part of this I maintained the continuous
    integration system running on TeamCity as well as the development and QA
    environments used by other employees.  I also worked on maintaining the
    applications around work order management which involved front end work as well
    as improvements to the backend which recorded the completion of work orders
    based off the GPS points from vehicles. 

[Dec 2011 - Feb 2012]{.job-header}
:   ### Software Development Intern for Hewlett Packard {.job-header}
    
    <p class="technologies">C#, SQL Server, Javascript</p>

    At Hewlett Packard I worked on recreating a legacy dashboard application
    using more modern technologies.  The new system pulled in data from a range of
    sources using a C# application which was then stored in a SQL Server database.
    A javascript frontend then retrieved the data and would display it using
    appropriate visualisations.  I was working here a summer scholarship program
    from the New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation.


## Education

2010 - 2012
:   ### Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

    <p class="technologies">University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand</p>

    <p class="technologies">Java, Python, Android, C</p>

    My final year project was to create an Android application for scoring
    softball games. This was developed with a scrum methodology in a group of six.
    I programmed much of the application as well as maintaining the source control
    systems and running Jenkins for our continuous integration process.
